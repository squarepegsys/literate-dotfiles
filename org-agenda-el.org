* Prologue

I don't do too much with the agenda part of OrgMode but I do like it -- easy to make contextual Todos and make notes on your thoughts on it. I don't use it as much as I should.. anyway I found some interesting things so I'll through it in here

First, and most importantly -- make my Agenda files under ~~/org~. My knowledge base is under ~~/org-kb~ -- I have found having fewer files to search for agenda items is much faster

#+begin_src lisp

(setq org-agenda-files '("~/org/" ))
#+end_src
* Menu Items

The idea behind the menu items come from 
https://joshrollinswrites.com/help-desk-head-desk/sub-menus-in-org/

It seems that Mr Rollins dived into the orgmode docs and found something good:

#+begin_src lisp
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("t" "Todo" )
      ("tw" "Well"  entry (file+headline "~/org/WellDot.org" "Welldot Tasks")
         "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")

      ("tf" "Farwell"  entry (file+headline "~/org/FarwellIrrigation.org" "Farwell Tasks")
         "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
      ("tt" "Misc" entry (file+headline "~/org/tasks.org" "Tasks")
         "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
      ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
         "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")
  )
)

#+end_src
